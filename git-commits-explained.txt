This is directions for when main ends up ahead of the development branch, and development needs to be updated 
with the changes. 
The following are the commands to use:
git checkout main //this is to switch branches from the development (work/test) branch to the main branch.
git pull origin main //this pulls the contents of the updated main branch to your local device.
git checkout development //this switches from main branch to development branch.
git merge main //this merges main branch with the development branch, updating the changes made, so the 
development branch will now be up-to-date.
