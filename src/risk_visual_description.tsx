        This traversal similar to the start node and distance section, shows nodes that are within a given
        distance or "risk" the user is willing to take.
      </p>
      <p>
        This traversal takes a start node and a distance. Once these are provided, a graph will be displayed, 
        with nodes colored "red" being within the given distance. Nodes colored "green" are unable to be
        reached with the distance provided.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The distances between the nodes and edges are determined by the original weights provided in the datasets.
        This is meant to show, given a specific risk the user is allowed to take, what nodes can be reached based
        on that distance. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The key difference between this section and the start node and distance is that this section shows all
        the nodes within a distance, while the other distance section shows just the nodes on the shortest path.
