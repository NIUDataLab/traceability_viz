To deploy a build, and actually use for a website, (does not have to be github pages), here is the process:
first run npx snowpack build, this will build the final project to be displayed.
You must make a docs folder, this is where github pages reads from.
Once this is done, delete everything except the .nojekyll from the docs folder.
Then copy and paste everything in the build folder into the docs folder. 
Once this is done, push to github.
Then go to settings, pages, and deploy the project. 
It may take a couple of tries to refresh, but this is the general process to follow for hosting.
